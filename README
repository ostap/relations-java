Relational algebra for Java

This is a small data processing toolkit for Java based on the relational model.
Exactly the same approach is utilised by relational databases to provide the data
independence (an ability to keep your data separate from the way you use it).
This project is an attempt to bring the key ideas used in the relational
databases into the Java world, keeping it as simple as possible.

Note that this toolkit operates solely within the JVM and does not require any
libraries apart from the standard JSE runtime.

Here is all you need to know to manipulate your data:
    * there is only one data abstraction - relation (similar to a table)
    * there are several relational operators, e.g. select, join, etc.
